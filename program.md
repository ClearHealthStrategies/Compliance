# Security Program Overview

`2021.08.09`

ClearHealth is committed to protecting its employees, partners,
clients/customers, and the company itself from damaging acts: either malicious or
unintentional in nature. This includes implementation of policies, standards,
controls, and procedures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of systems and data according to their risk level.

The ClearHealth security program and policies are developed on the
principles that:

1. Security is everyone's responsibility; 
2. Self-management is best encouraged by rewarding the right behaviors.

To ensure that ClearHealth's information security is implemented and operated in accordance 
with policies and procedures,  ClearHealth’s approach to managing information security and 
its implementation  (i.e. policies, standards, processes, and procedures for information security) 
shall be reviewed independently at planned intervals or when significant changes occur.

Managers shall regularly review the compliance of information processing and procedures 
within their area of responsibility with the appropriate security policies, standards, and any other 
security requirements. Information systems shall be regularly reviewed for compliance with ClearHealth’s 
information security policies and standards.
