This policy establishes the scope, objectives, and procedures of ClearHealth's
information security risk management process. The risk management process is
intended to support and protect the organization and its ability to fulfill its
mission.

## Policy Statements

(a) A thorough risk assessment must be conducted to evaluate the potential
threats and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability
of sensitive, confidential, and proprietary electronic information it stores,
transmits, and/or processes.

(b) Risk assessments must be performed with any major change to ClearHealth's
business or technical operations and/or supporting infrastructure, no less than
once per year.

(c) Strategies shall be developed to mitigate or accept the risks identified in
the risk assessment process.

(d) Maintain documentation of all risk assessment, risk management, and risk
mitigation efforts for a minimum of seven years.

(e) Security analysis must be performed for any open source software and/or
third-party components and dependencies included in ClearHealth's software
products. Any software or service not meeting the requirements must be disabled,
have additional controls mitigating against vulnerabilities, or an alternative
must be used.
