# Third Party Security, Vendor Risk Management and Systems/Services Acquisition

`2021.08.03`

ClearHealth makes every effort to assure all third-party organizations are
compliant and do not compromise the integrity, security, and privacy of ClearHealth
or ClearHealth's customer data. Third-Parties include vendors, customers, partners,
subcontractors, and contracted developers.

## Policy Statements

ClearHealth policy requires that:

(a) A list of approved vendors/partners must be maintained and reviewed
annually.

(b) Approval from management, procurement and security must be in place prior to
onboarding any new vendor or contractor.  Additionally, all changes to existing
contract agreements must be reviewed and approved prior to implementation.

(c) For any technology solution that needs to be integrated with ClearHealth
production environment or operations, a Vendor Technology Review must be
performed by the Security Team to understand and approve the risk.  Periodic
compliance assessment and SLA review may be required.

(d) ClearHealth's customers or partners should not be allowed access outside of their
own environment, meaning they cannot access, modify, or delete any data
belonging to other third-parties.

(e) Additional vendor agreements are obtained as required by applicable
regulatory compliance requirements.

* A standard HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (BAA) is defined and includes
  the required security controls in accordance with the organization's security
  policies. Additionally, responsibility is assigned in these agreements. A BAA
  must be signed with any vendor that may have a business need to access, and/or
  unsupervised access to PHI or ePHI.
