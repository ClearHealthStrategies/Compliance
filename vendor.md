ClearHealth makes every effort to assure all third-party organizations are
compliant and do not compromise the integrity, security, and privacy of
ClearHealth or ClearHealth's customer data. Third-Parties include vendors,
customers, partners, subcontractors, and contracted developers.

## Policy Statements

ClearHealth policy requires that:

(a) A list of approved vendors/partners must be maintained and reviewed
annually.

onboarding any new vendor or contractor. Additionally, all changes to existing
contract agreements must be reviewed and approved prior to implementation.

production environment or operations, a Vendor Technology Review must be
performed by the Security Team to understand and approve the risk. Periodic
compliance assessment and SLA review may be required.

​​​(d) ClearHealth ensures that third-party organizations use appropriate change
management procedures for any changes to a third-party service or organizational
system. The risk management process is tracked in Mercury.

​(e) ClearHealth delegated to Rackspace and Optum the periodic audit of  the
network services to ensure that network service providers  have implemented the
required security features and meet the requirements agreed with management,
including new and existing regulations.

(f) ClearHealth's customers or partners should not be allowed access outside of
their own environment, meaning they cannot access, modify, or delete any data

- A standard HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (BAA) is defined and includes
  the required security controls in accordance with the organization's security
  policies. Additionally, responsibility is assigned in these agreements. A BAA
  must be signed with any vendor that may have a business need to access, and/or
  unsupervised access to PHI or ePHI.
