data is protected from unauthorized access and that it is available when needed.
The following policies drive many of our procedures and technical controls in
support of the ClearHealth mission of data protection. ClearHealth must
share the following policies and procedures with our workforce, undergo review by a manager,
and update the documentation if necessary on an annual basis.

described in this section.
